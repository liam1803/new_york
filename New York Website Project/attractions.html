	<h2> The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum </h2>

	<p>	The National September 11 Memorial & Museum is a place of remembrance honoring those who perished in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and
		February 26, 1993. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with 30-foot waterfalls
		cascading down their sides. </p>

	<p> The nearly 3,000 names of the men, women, and children killed in the attacks are inscribed into bronze parapets surrounding the twin
		Memorial pools. The 9/11 Memorial is open daily from 7:30 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. and is free to the public. The 9/11 Memorial Museum displays monumental
		artifacts linked to the events of 9/11, while presenting intimate stories of loss, compassion, reckoning and recovery that are central to telling the
		story of the 2001 and 1993 attacks and the aftermath. It also explores the global impact of 9/11 and its continuing significance. </p>
